# calculator

This is a calculator web app designed to have moderate functionality.
Really quite proud of this! Making big progress and this has really cemented my understanding of functions and calling them
through different operations, and especially event listeners. Had some fun finding out about some styling options and got 
my head around the grid display features too, styling this was a bit of a headache at first, but now I think the final 
product is simple, very easy to look at and gentle on the eyes in terms of colour scheming. If anyone is reading these
readme files and has seen my other products...yes, I love beige, probably far too much. 

The biggest win for me in this project was having the idea to have a second display pop up upon entering an operator, a lot of other users functionality had a smaller display within the main one to show the previously entered numbers, but I really like
the idea of a retro-future calculator that pops up with another little display when you hit certain buttons, and retracts
when you hit others. I really want to come back to this and figure out how to make the second display actually slide up and down
when it's called, as well as add a slick sound to it, but I'm not quite at that stage with my CSS development and I think it would just distract me from the progress I'm making with learning Javascript at the moment.

Thanks for reading, thanks for looking at it, and please, employ me! :)
